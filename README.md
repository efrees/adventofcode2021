Solutions to [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021)

We're doin' it again!

This year I'm hoping to lower the time committment by solving first in C#. I will likely end up solving some in other
languages later and will track which solutions I've done, using the chart below.

## Progress

## Results
I've added `output.txt` as a reference for my answers (for convenient checking while refactoring) and runtimes of my solutions.
